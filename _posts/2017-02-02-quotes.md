This outing with Alexa was less enlightening than the last; the main time sink here was in correctly configuring the zip file that needed to be uploaded to AWS portal.

Other than that, there was some time spent in considering what types of things an average consumer would say when they wanted to hear a random fact? The route I chose to curate was one in which the available collection of statements were quotes from the famous philosopher, Confucius. To me, this seemed like a prototypical "fact of the day" situation, so I selected my Intent Utterances according to that mindset.

Of course, the user may say 'what did confucius say?' or 'confucius say', but then there's also 'what's my quote for the day' and 'tell me a quote', etc. Overall I made 16 utterances, which demonstrates that a good bit of thought needs to go into predicting what the end user may want to say in order to interact with the app.
