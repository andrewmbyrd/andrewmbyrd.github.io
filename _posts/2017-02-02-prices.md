title: Building an Alexa Skill to report Stock Prices
---

This will be my first foray into creating a custom skill that is truly my own. I've elected to develop a skill that will report stock prices to you upon request. I say stock prices here, but depending on if I am able to get access to a reliable API, the commodity of interest may well be cards instead. I'm a big fan of Magic: the Gathering, and anyone very familiar with the game knows that the prices of the cards can be very expensive and have a high fluctuation through time.

Take a look at this graph of Nintendo's stock price over the past year.

Now take a look the the price of one Magic: the Gathering card, the so-called Verdurous Gearhulk.

As you can see, the cards aren't cheap, and their prices can change dramatically in a short period of time, just like shares in the stock market.

Now, regardless of which commodity ends up being the subject of the project, the logic and interface is the same. The user will invoke the function by saying something along the lines of "Alexa, open Prices", or "Alexa ask Prices for the current value of {company/card}". I've established more than a dozen Utterances to respond to requests to the app, and I'm sure more will follow.

Naturally, just knowing the price of a stock/card now has its uses, but the real value for financial consideration comes in comparing the price now to how it was some arbitrary length of time in the past. After selecting a commodity, the user will be able to compare it to its price in the past using the following Utterances:

{% highlight js %}
GetHistoryIntent {amount} {duration} 
GetHistoryIntent {amount} {duration} ago
GetHistoryIntent yesterday
GetHistoryIntent last {duration}
{% endhighlight %}

A typical response from Alexa could be "{company} was worth {price} {amount} {duration] ago, compared to {price} today - a {differnce} {dollar/%} {increase/decrease}".

What can't be conveyed easily through Alexa's voice is a graph like those above _showing_ the user what prices have done. This is the benefit of Alexa's Standard Card service. Through a companion app, users can see and reference a response in a more intuitive way for long term analysis.

					"Verdurous Gearhulk is worth $20 todoay, up from $7 four months ago"
