Learning about the high-level workings of Amazon's Alexa platform was an interesting endeavour. I had been under the impression that Alexa was some Watson-like AI that could understand and interpret the subleties of lanuage. Turns out, the reality is more down to Earth than that. In my experience, the power of Alexa comes in precise voice-to-text (and vice-versa) technology, as well as the architecture for executing commands. Through Amazon's (free) web services and developer tool accounts, anyone can create a so-called "Skill" for Alexa, test it, and publish it for mass consumption.

The architecture allows you to just use plain old JavaScript to create, in this case, a trivia application. The entirety of the processing portion of your code goes into a so-called Lambda Function in Amazon Web services. Having created that function, you're provided with a unique key, which is what will be used to tie the project to Alexa's voice recognition technology.

Now from Amazon's developer tools, you provide that unique key to associate your project with Alexa. The key here is in the Intent Schema and Sample Utterances. Intents are the information that is passed back to your application code, based on the voice input provided to them. Amazon has a few ready-made Intents, with common phrases such as "I don't know" or "exit". You can create your own custom Intents that have properties associated with them called Slots. So for example, in our trivia application, we can create an Intent - AnswerIntent - that takes voice input from the user. The custom Slots are the responses WE ARE EXPECTING, in this case the number of the multiple-choice selection the user has made (1, 2, 3 or 4).

So here's where my disillusion with the magical AI vanished - in order to define the Intent, YOU MUST TELL ALEXA what phrases are to be expected. In the Sample Utterances section, the developer must explicitly say that AnswerIntent is defined by the phrase(s) "I think the answer is {answer}", or "I choose {answer}", where {answer} is an item from the list of things you defined in the Slots.

So tying into the API is quite intuitive and easily accessible, which is a great plus. Having to define explicitly what we expect users to say is less so.
