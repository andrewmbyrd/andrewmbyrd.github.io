I started working in New Orleans as a Petroleum Engineer for Shell Oil Company. The work was rewarding, and I was exposed to many experiences that I otherwise wouldn't have been. Still, the petroleum industry was a bit too slow for my liking. Decisions can take months or even years to be implemented. This isn't without reason; every time a piece of equipment is installed or changed, we were potentially exposing personnel to thousands of pounds of pressure from explosive fluids. So I fully understand why the industry has to move as slowly as it does, but that pace can have a negative impact on the rate of a young employee's learning.

In my last assignment in Shell, I was working closely with programmers to build systems that could relieve our engineers from routine surveillance that could be better performed by a computer. During the assignment, I helped to develop algorithms in English that our programmers converted into code. I was also tasked with ensuring that our code implementations were delivered in a timely manner. Naturally, management from the teams who were the beneficiaries of our work needed a contact point to explain what our software was doing, so I filled that role as well. All of this helped me to realize that I am the most engaged and most productive when I am working with computer systems to make people's lives easier. The fact that our team could have an idea for improved service and then turn around and implement that idea within a matter of days or weeks was hugely motivating. I chose to pursue an education in software engineering so that I could always do that kind of work.

I enrolled in Bloc, an online Software Engineering bootcamp. Since October of 2016, I have built several projects, all of which are detailed on the home page of this site. During this time, I have learned and built applications with JavaScript, Node.js, AngularJS, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, myriad rubygems, Chrome and Firefox plug-ins, Google's Firebase array, TypeScript, and Amazon Web Services.

The greatest lesson I've learned with Bloc is that I was able to find out how to accomplish whatever task was set before me. Coming into the program, I knew next to nothing about developing for the Web, and in just a few short months I feel more prepared for a programming job than I did coming out of four years of University. I look forward to continued learning in this challenging field.
