I started working in New Orleans as a Petroleum Engineer for Shell Oil Company. The work was rewarding, and I was exposed to many experiences that I otherwise wouldn't have been. Still, the petroleum industry was a bit too slow for my liking. Decisions can take months or even years to be implemented. This isn't without reason; every time a piece of equipment is installed or changed, we were potentially exposing personnel to thousands of pounds of pressure from explosive fluids. So I fully understand why the industry has to move as slowly as it does, but that pace can have a negative impact on the rate of a young employee's learning.

In my last assignment in Shell, I was working closely with programmers to build systems that could relieve our engineers from routine surveillance that could be better performed by a computer. During the assignment, I helped to develop algorithms in English that our programmers converted into code. I was also tasked with ensuring that our code implementations were delivered in a timely manner. Naturally, management from the teams who were the beneficiaries of our work needed a contact point to explain what our software was doing, so I filled that role as well. All of this helped me to realize that I am the most engaged and most productive when I am working with computer systems to make people's lives easier. The fact that our team could have an idea for improved service and then turn around and implement that idea within a matter of days or weeks was hugely motivating. I chose to pursue an education in software engineering so that I could always do that kind of work.

I enrolled in Bloc, an online Software Engineering bootcamp. There, I built several projects, many of which are detailed on the home page of this site. I learned several techonologies directly through the program, inlcuding the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript for fundamental Web Development. I architected server-side solutions with Ruby, framed with Ruby on Rails and ensured by the testing suite RSpec. I designed projects of my choice using Canvas.js and Node.js.

Furthering my learning outside of the curriculum, I contributed to open-source development. In order to do this, I had to become familiar with TypeScript. I created my own fully re-usable Menu app using React.js.

Since then, my software development work has been focused and bolstered by my efforts at Koddi. I have become expertly proficient in PHP, phpUnit, Symfony/Silex, jQuery, React, Postgres, MySQL and more. Hiring on in October of 2017, I have achieved multiple promotions and merit recognitions for my continued demonstrations of excellence; this applies not only to software development, but also to my work in QA, project delivery, and cross-team communication.

I continue to develop my skillset with courses in Udemy, most recently React and GameMaker.
