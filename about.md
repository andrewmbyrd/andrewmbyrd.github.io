I am on a journey to help develop the most fun and interesting technologies to be used the world over. I started on this mission before I even realized it, way back in high school. If there's anything I've learned along the way, it's that chasing money won't always get you to where you want to be.

In my high school years in Katy, TX from 2004-2008, I was fortunate enough to have the same math teacher for 3 years in a row. Her technique of providing elegant, clear explanations of complex concepts combined with hands-off guidance for in-class work (no homework. ever.) amounted to the perfect environment for me to understand the material. This initial interest, this environment for learning and working, is what set me off on my current path.

Given my fondness for maths, when it came time to apply for college, I knew I wanted to be in the field of engineering. Now, at the time when I was about to graduate high school, the iPhone and iPod touch had just released. I was fascinated at how people were able to create such a device. I went into college with a head for computer/electrical engineering. I was bound for the University of Texas at Austin.

I arrived there with my major in electrical engineering locked down, I went to orientation, I saw the average starting salaries of different engineering majors, and I promptly switched to Petroleum Engineering! I graduated in 2012 with my B.S. in Petroleum Engineering, and moved down to New Orleans to work for a major oil company.

I enjoyed some aspects of the work, but the delay of gratification - the time between having an idea and implementing it, the time between learning a new concept and actually being able to appy it - was too great. I learned my mind was sculpted or at least attracted to the environment of my high school math learning. After 4 years with the company, I decided to take my leave.

Now, I'm back to where I probably should have been 8 years ago: no job, no income, and learning software engineering! I'm excited to see where this path leads.
