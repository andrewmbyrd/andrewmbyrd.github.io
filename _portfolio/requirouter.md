## Summary

It can be a great hassle to visually navigate your way up your file structure to ensure that you have the correct path relative to a file that needs to be required. requirouter takes the mundane legwork out of grabbing the correct file. A full write up of how the project works and how to install it can be found on my github page, <a href="https://github.com/andrewmbyrd/requirouter">here</a>.

But, it's good for us developers to understand _why_ an algorithm can get us the correct relative path between any two files. For more on path structure, visit my blog post <a href="http://www.byrdmanblog.com/2017/04/28/file-structure.html">here</a>.
